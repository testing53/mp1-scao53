## Importing the calendar

Uncomment the first line below and replace FILL_FILE_NAME with the name of your calendar file:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# calendar_data <- "FILL_FILE_NAME.ics" |> 
  ## Use ical package to import into R and then convert to "tibble" data frame format:
  # ical_parse_df() |> 
  # as_tibble() |> 
  ## Use lubridate packge to wrangle dates and times. We'll do this later this semester:
  # mutate(
  #  start_datetime = with_tz(start, tzone = "America/New_York"),
  #  end_datetime = with_tz(end, tzone = "America/New_York"),
  #  minutes = end_datetime - start_datetime,
  #  date = floor_date(start_datetime, unit = "day")
  #) |>
  ## Make calendar entry summary all lowercase:
  # mutate(summary = tolower(summary)) |> 
  ## Do data wrangling to compute number of minutes and hours:
  # group_by(date, summary) |>
  # summarize(minutes = sum(minutes) |> as.numeric()) |>
  # If minutes are incorrectly reported in hours, uncomment next line to correct: 
  # mutate(minutes = minutes*60) |>
  # (Optional) To filter dates for only those between 2019-09-03 and 2019-09-07, 
  ## uncomment next line:
  # filter(date >= "2019-09-03" & date <= "2019-09-07") |> 
  # mutate(hours = minutes/60)
```

Make sure you data looks good by looking at the data:

```{r}
# glimpse(calendar_data)
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
## Note by setting eval=FALSE, R Markdown will not "evaluate" this code chunk and 
## ignore it.
# View(calendar_data)
```
